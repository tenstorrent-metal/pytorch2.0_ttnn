# `torch_ttnn` Module

The `torch_ttnn` module has a `backend` function, which can used with the `torch.compile()` function.

```python
import torch
import torch_ttnn

# A torch Module
class FooModule(torch.Module):
    ...
# Create a module
module = FooModule()
# Compile the module, with ttnn backend
ttnn_module = torch.compile(module, torch_ttnn.backend)
# Running inference
ttnn_module(input_data)
```

# Results

The table below summarizes the results of running various ML models through our TTNN compiler. For each model, we track whether the run was successful, the number of operations before and after conversion, the number of `to_device` and `from_device` operations, performance metrics, and accuracy.

## Explanation of Metrics

# Tracer
The tracer dump the information of fx graph such as node's op_name and shape.

For example, you can run this script to parse the information
```
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 tools/run_torchvision.py --backend torch_stat --backward --profile
ls stat/raw
```

By default, the raw result will be stored at `stat/raw`, and you can run this script to generate the report
```
python3 tools/generate_report.py
ls stat/
```
Now the `stat/` folder have these report
 - `fw_node_count.csv`
 - `bw_node_count.csv`
 - `fw_total_input_size_dist/`
 - `bw_total_input_size_dist/`
 - `fw_total_output_size_dist/`
 - `bw_total_output_size_dist/`
 - `profile/`

The `node_count.csv` show the node with `op_type` appear in the fx graph. This report can help analyze the frequency of op type appear in the graph.

The `*_total_*_size_dist/` statistics the `op_type`'s input/output_size distribution from all fx graph recored in `stat/raw`. This report can help analyze the memory footprint durning the calculation of `op_type`.

 - Notice: the default `input_shapes` in `tools/stat_torchvision.py` is `[1,3,224,224]`, which has dependency with `*_total_*_size_dist/` report.

 - Notice: the [aten ir interface is in there](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.compiler_ir.html)

[The `profile/` is the tools provided by pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/profiler_recipe.html), you can open it by the url: chrome://tracing

# Run transformer models
To run transformer model with ttnn backend, run:
```
PYTHONPATH=${{TT_METAL_HOME}}:$(pwd) python3 tools/run_transformers.py --model "phiyodr/bert-large-finetuned-squad2" --backend torch_ttnn
```

You can also substitute the backend with `torch_stat` to run a reference comparison.
